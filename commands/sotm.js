We have had this contest in the past but removed it because we ran out of members to use for **MOTM**! Now, we have a lot more member than before!\n \n **Explanation:** It's pretty simple, a staff member chooses a member every month to be the **MOTM**! The **MOTM** will get a role called '**Member of the Month**' and will keep it until we elect the next member!")
